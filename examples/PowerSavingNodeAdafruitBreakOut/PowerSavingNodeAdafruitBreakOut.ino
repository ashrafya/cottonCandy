/**
 * This example is similar to the Node.ino example. However, this program
 * is written for a specific hardware platform to improve the power consumption.
 * 
 * Our test uses the following hardware setup. You can interchange some
 * pin assignments based your situation. Please be careful with the wirings.
 * Use the example at your own risk.
 * 
 * 1. Atmega328P-based board (our tests use the barebone circuit)
 * 
 * 2. DS3231 RTC 
 *    SQW connected to Digital Pin 2 (INT0).
 *    
 *    I2C on DS3231 are connected to common ATmega328 I2C pins.
 *    
 *    Note: If you want to acheive the best power consumption,
 *    use a battery to operate the RTC for time-keeping.
 *    
 *    VCC connected to Digital Pin 7. (You do not need to do this 
 *    if you do not concern about the power consumption)
 *    
 *    Remember to 
 *    1) desolder the charing resistor pack (IMPORTANT)
 *    2) desolder the pull-up resistor pack for SQW and I2C lines, and
 *       add your own pull-up resistors for I2C.
 *    
 * 3. Adafruit RFM9X LoRa breakout 
 *    IRQ pin connected to Digital Pin 3 (INT1).
 *    
 *    For CS and RST pins you can really use any available digital pins.
 *    
 *    SPI on the breakout are connected to common ATmega328 SPI pins.
